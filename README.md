## Description

We lately propose PE-GPT (2024 Sep), **the first multimodal large language model (LLM) specifically designed for power electronics (PE) design**. What impedes the adoption of LLMs in the industry of power electronics mainly includes their limited technical expertise and incapability to process PE-specific data. To address these challenges, PE-GPT is enhanced by retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with customized PE knowledge base, which empowers PE-GPT with PE-specific knowledge and reasoning, while model zoo and simulation repository equip it with the capability of processing PE-specific multi-modal data. Moreover, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM agent, metaheuristic algorithms, a Model Zoo, and a Simulation Repository.

## Deploy PE-GPT on your PC
* To deploy PE-GPT on your PC, the first step is to setup your API call to OpenAI models, please see core/llm/llm.py for more details. <br>
* If you want to interact with Plecs software to simulate the designed modulation for DAB, you need to enable the xml-rpc interface in Plecs settings,
and to add the directory "core/simulation/devices" in the device library searching path in plecs.

# change the current working directory
cd PE-GPT

# install all required dependencies
pip install -r requirements_specific.txt

# run the GUI and chat with PE-GPT
streamlit run main.py

## Notes
* This repository provides a simplified version of the PE-GPT methodology presented in our journal paper. Despite the simplifications, the released code preserves the overall core architecture of the proposed PE-GPT.
<br><br>
* This repository currently includes the following functions/blocks: Retrieval augmented generation, LLM agents, Model Zoo (with a physics-in-architecture neural network, PANN, for modeling DAB converters), metaheuristic algorithm for optimization, simulation verification, graphical user interface, and knowledge base. Please note that the current knowledge base is a simplified version for illustration.
